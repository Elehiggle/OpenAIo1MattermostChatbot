# OpenAIo1MattermostChatbot

![Mattermost chat with bot example](./chat.png)

This project is a chatbot for Mattermost that integrates with the OpenAI API to provide helpful responses to user messages. The chatbot - like this readme - is mostly written by **Claude 3 AI**, listens for messages mentioning the chatbot or direct messages, processes the messages, and sends the responses back to the Mattermost channel.

## Attention (Preview)

Since OpenAI's o1 model is in preview, it lacks a lot of features like vision, tools, and thus also image generation. Use my ChatGPT project instead if you want those features. The o1 model might be added to my ChatGPT project in the future, but for now it requires too many changes.

## Features

- **Responds to messages** mentioning "@chatbot" (or rather the chatbot's username) or direct messages
- Extracts **images, PDFs and other files** from message attachments and from **URL links** in messages
- Supports **FlareSolverr** to bypass Javascript/CAPTCHA restrictions
- **Gets transcripts of YouTube videos** for easy tl;dw summarizations. Title, description and uploader are also
  provided
- Maintains context of the conversation within a thread
- Sends typing indicators to show that the chatbot is processing the message
- Utilizes a thread pool to handle multiple requests concurrently (due to `mattermostdriver-asyncio` being outdated)
- Offers **Docker support** for easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or just a server with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) _(you can get away with using 3.8 if
  you use datetime.datetime.utcnow() instead of datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC))_
- OpenAI API key
- Mattermost Bot token (alternatively personal access token or login/password for a dedicated Mattermost user account for the chatbot)
- The bot account needs to be added to the team and to the channels you want it to watch

## Installation

1. Prepare a Mattermost bot account token and OpenAI API key

    - Create an OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
    - Create a Mattermost bot account token directly in the chat: _Left menu -> Integrations -> Bot accounts_. Give it
      the post:channels permission (this also suffices for DMs)

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Elehiggle/OpenAIo1MattermostChatbot.git
    cd OpenAIo1MattermostChatbot
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   _or alternatively:_
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install openai tiktoken mattermostdriver certifi beautifulsoup4 httpx youtube-transcript-api yt-dlp PyMuPDF pymupdf4llm  validators
    ```

4. Set the following environment variables with your own values:

| `MAX_TOKENS`                  | The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Default: "4096" (max)                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `TEMPERATURE`                 | The temperature value for controlling the randomness of the generated responses (0.0 = analytical, 1.0 = fully random).

| `TYPE_INDICATOR_MODE`         | "FULL" = typing indicator will be sent to main thread/channel and the subthread; "THREAD" = only to the subthread, unless there is none (this is kinda expected behaviour, but I prefer full). Default: "FULL"                                                                |

If you use this, MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE_MB won't be honored since it can't stream content. For most effectiveness, use a residential IP endpoint |
| `KEEP_ALL_URL_CONTENT`        | Whether to feed the AI all URL content from the whole conversation thread. The website result is cached in memory. If you only want it to know about the current message's URL content (due to context size or cost), set to "FALSE". Default: "TRUE"                         |
| `MATTERMOST_IGNORE_SENDER_ID` | The user ID of a user to ignore (optional, useful if you have multiple chatbots that are not real bot accounts to prevent endless loops). Supports multiple, separated by comma                                                                                               |

| `AI_API_BASEURL`              | AI API Base URL. Default: None (which will use "<https://api.openai.com/v1/>").

| `LOG_LEVEL`                   | The log level. Default: "INFO"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Default: "INFO"                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python3 chatbot.py
```

The chatbot will connect to the Mattermost server and start listening for messages.
When a user mentions the chatbot in a message or sends a direct message to the chatbot, the chatbot will process the
message, extract content from links (if any), process images, PDFs and other files, and send the response back to the Mattermost channel.

> **Note:** If you don't trust your users at all, it's recommended to disable the URL/image grabbing feature, even though the chatbot filters out local addresses and IPs.

### Running with Docker

You can also run the chatbot using Docker. Use the following command to run the chatbot container:

```bash
docker run -d --name chatbotgpt \
  -e AI_API_KEY="your_ai_api_key" \
  -e AI_MODEL="o1-preview" \
  -e MATTERMOST_URL="mattermostinstance.example.com" \
  -e MATTERMOST_TOKEN="your_mattermost_token" \
  -e TEMPERATURE="1" \
  ghcr.io/elehiggle/openaio1mattermostchatbot:latest
```

## How does this bot differ from the official Mattermost AI plugin?

The official [Mattermost AI plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ai) is a great way to integrate AI
into your Mattermost server with its own advantages, like a nice UI.
However, the features differ greatly. It requires direct access to the server, whereas this bot merely needs a bot token
and can be conveniently used in a Docker environment.

Also there is:

- no fine granular control over certain settings (especially AI settings)
- no CAPTCHA bypass
- no PDF parsing
- no YouTube transcript fetching
- and more

While the official plugin certainly will improve over time, this bot here will too and there will be certain features
that will absolutely never make it into the official plugin, due to it primarily focusing on features for developers
like function calling to retrieve GitHub issues, for example.

## Known Issues

While the chatbot works great for me, there might still be some bugs lurking inside. I have done my best to address
them, but if you encounter any issues, please let me know!

## Monkey Patch

Please note that the monkey patch in the code is necessary due to some SSL errors that occur because of a mistake within the `mattermostdriver` library. The patch ensures that the chatbot can establish a secure connection with the Mattermost server.
